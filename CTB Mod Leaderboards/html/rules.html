			<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
			<p>I haven't recieved any inside information on how badge decisions are made, neither have I contributed any advice to the people who make those decisions.<br>There is no guarantee that the requirements match what I'm measuring here; they may be more strict, less strict or entirely different.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The requirements for this leaderboard</h3>
			<p>The default requirement is to have a score recorded on the osu! leaderboards for every ranked map made for catch the beat. No loved, no coverts are required.<br>The only exception to this are maps that have been DMCAd. These are no longer available, so they are not required for this leaderboard.</p>
			<p>Difficulty reducing mods such as Half Time, Easy & No Fail are allowed. This avoids restricting 100% to the very small group of players who can pass the hardest maps.</p>
			<p>Although NF is allowed, starting a map & leaving it to play on it's own is not. You've got to actually play.<br>There's no way to automatically check for AFK, so any play below 50% accuracy will be flagged as suspcious & not counted.<br>This cutoff should remove all AFK plays while still being reachable even by new players on hard maps. In the worst case, HTNF can be used.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>When you reach 100%</h3>
			<p>Do not bother random staff members, they've got other stuff to do.<br>The correct way to get yourself on the list to check is send an email to support[at]ppy[dot]sh, briefly stating that you have achieved 100% in catch the beat & would like to be considered for the completionist badge.<br>There may be some delay, there is no need to worry or send additional emails/messages. When badges are awarded, they're back-dated to when they were initially achieved</p>
			<br>
			<h3>If you're at 99% & can't find the last maps</h3>
			<p>If you contact me, I'd be happy to use the same data that I use to make this leaderboard to provide a list of the maps you've missed<br>I'm zoggoth on Discord, osu!, github & a bunch of other sites. Discord is easiest<br>The data I use comes out at the start of each month. Although it is technically possible to check at any time, I would recommend maintaining 100% until the end of the month so it can easily be checked</p>
